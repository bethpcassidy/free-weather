Mon Jan 20th Update



EZWeather, an app that gathers, processes and displays Weather-Data.


Functionality
- Users/session data
- Saved preset locations based on user (up to 3)
- Non-users can still look for weather
- search by zip code, weather pops up
- Image is pulled from assets to represent current conditions (sun for sunny, cloud for cloudy, etc)
- Users can have multiple saved forecast locations

Data
- forecast model
- user model
- saved forecasts
- api interpolation
- image model? Maybe image should be an integer to decide which picture is displayed based on conditionals the weather.


API
- open-meteo.com
- GFS
- converter from zip code to longitude and latitude, this might not need to be an api though I wonder if bootstrap has stuff for this in REACT, it really depends on if its easier to all be in my backend for organization reasons, (update: the term is geocoding, shouldn't be hard, I am using geocode.maps.co)

-----------

Backend
- Established an early version of a forecast model, going to make a form to take in a zip code
- API testing through get requests to decide what I am going to use
- Create functions to process the data and clean it up for presentation
- User model

------------------

First Updates

- I've finished basic CRUD actions for the forecasts controller which has lead me to thinking about how other tables will interact with the forecast table overall. 
- I plan on creating assets for sunshine and snow and rain and pulling those up would be easiest in a separate table. 
- If I want to save location data while weather variables change over time, would it not be easiest to to have a location table where I can keep geocode information (no reason to ping the geocode api every time I want an updated forecast, might as well create a conditional to search the table for the zip code first, and then follow up on the ping if its not there).

--

Frontend
- Generated the frontend and linked it with my backend and am a step away from create functionality.
- I was getting stuck on some of my development so switching gears and catching up my frontend gave me some ground to stand on and move forward with what I am doing in the backend.
	[ie: grabbing zipcode, generating forecast data, and adding it to your list of forecasts.]

API info Grabs

- Set up my frontend for login/logouts/deletes/shows/basic modal
- Real weather is showing up!
- Information is being grabbed by backend with get requests and I spent the last portion of class getting it to print out basic weather data on the frontend.
- Created a loop through hourly temperature change information to get a high low index on temperature

--------------

Thurs JAN 5 2022

New Frontend
- Update: Changed update to allow a 1 click refresh in the modal. I should call the update method each time the website is opened or maybe create a get weather button that just triggers it. 
- Update also now is just a button instead of a parameter form.
- New: New now only requires a zip code.
- Implemented a new back-end

New Backened
- Added location name to model via migration.
- Created basic user authentication bones but haven't required it yet.

Plans: 
- Implement user authentication in basic functions.
- Iron out update function
- Image creating and sorting
- Move away from cards most likely
- Multiple pages on REACT
- Homepage design ideas flushed out (have a concrete plan)
